# MechaCar Statistical Analysis (Module 15)

## Overview
AutosRU is developing a new prototype vehicle, the MechaCar. Data has been collected on various factors which impact the mpg and the suspension. This analysis performs a statistical analysis against these factors to determine how they impact the MechaCar.

### Resources
**Input**: MechaCar_mpg.csv, Suspension_Coll.csv <br/>
**Software**: R, RStudio <br/>
**Output**: GitHub ReadMe <br/>

## Results
The following are the results of the statistical analysis.

### Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
A linear regression analysis was run against the MPG data. Using a signicance level of 0.05 the results show that vehicle weight, spoiler angle and AWD likely have little to no statistical impact on MPG, while vehicle length and ground clearance do have a statistical impact on MPG. The overall p-value for the linear regression is very small (5.3x10^11) which indicates that the slope of the regression line is not zero (indicating a corelation between the factors and MPG). In addition the r-squared value is high (0.71) whcih indicates a strong overall correlation between the data and the MPG. 

### Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
### Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
### Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
